                Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is an American businessman,
                television personality, author, and politician. He is chairman of
                The Trump Organization, which is the principal holding company for
                 his real estate ventures and other business interests. He is also
                 the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party for President of
                 the United States in the 2016 election.
                Trump graduated from the Wharton School of the University of
                Pennsylvania in 1968. Having worked in his father Fred Trump's
                real estate and construction firm while attending college, he
                assumed control of that family business in 1973, later renaming
                it The Trump Organization. During his career, Trump has built
                hotels, casinos, golf courses, the Manhattan neighborhood Riverside
                South and numerous other developments, many of which bear his name,
                including Trump Entertainment Resorts (now owned by Carl Icahn).
